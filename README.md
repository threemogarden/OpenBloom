# OpenBloom
An open collection of planting guides, data tools, and Python scripts for gardeners and plant enthusiasts.

## 🌿 Overview
**OpenBloom** is a public knowledge repository created by **3Mo Garden (Canada)** to share useful, non-commercial materials from our gardening and data projects.  
It bridges gardening wisdom and data science — offering practical planting information alongside transparent examples of code used to analyze or visualize it.
